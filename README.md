This repository contains the DocBook XSLT 1.0 Stylesheets, now
migrated away from SourceForge.

There are still some rough edges here as the build system and various
other things are being ported.

Nevertheless, this is now the intended repository of record.

The latest stable release is available at
https://github.com/docbook/xslt10-stylesheets/releases/download/release/1.79.2/docbook-xsl-1.79.2.zip

For build instructions please refer to the [DocBook XSL Release Build Process](building.md).
